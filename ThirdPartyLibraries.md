# Third-Party Libraries

This guide focuses on integrating third-party libraries that are not packaged as Angular modules in alignment with the app architecture generated by Angular CLI.

Specifically, we will look at installing [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

## Install Dependencies

`yarn add moment`

## Include Modules

Open `angular-cli.json` and add moment.

```json
{
  ...
  "apps": [
     ...
     "scripts": [
        "../node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js"
     ],
     ...
  ]
  ...
}
```

## Start using Moment.js

Open any components and import moment:

```typescript
import * as moment from 'moment';
```

Get current date and time:

```typescript
now: string = moment().format()
```
